# distance-matrix
Calculate travel distance, time and time in traffic for multiple transportation methods using the google maps API.

It uses an .csv file as input with all the adresses, and outputs another .csv file with all the requested data.
If the input adresses are larger than the google maps distance matrix API, it will use multiple requests to get everything.
